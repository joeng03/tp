## Using this guide  
This section provides an introduction to the terminology used in this user guide. 

### Person

For the entire user guide the term person is used to refer to the patient of which the pharmacist is addressing.
Persons are the people with whom you track your Orders and information for.   
To create an order with a person, they must first have been added to the app.

A person has the following attributes:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email Address
- Address
- Allergy(If the person has one. Can be one or more)

A person is uniquely identified by their name. No two persons can have the same name and names are case-insensitive.

### Order

An order refers to a purchase of one or more medicines by a particular person in the person list.

An Order has the following attributes:
- Order Number
- Person (Who the order belongs to)
- Medicine (What is in the order. Can be one or more)
- Status of the order

Orders are uniquely identified by their order numbers. No two orders can have the same order number.   
No order containing a medicine that the person is allergic to can be added without a special flag.  
Orders will automatically tag under the <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span>
Status when added.

### Status

Status is used to describe the process at which the order is at.
Status can only be updated/modified following their chronological order.

<span style="background-color: red; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">PENDING/PD</span>
->
<span style="background-color: blue; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">PREPARING/PR</span>
->
<span style="background-color: green; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">COMPLETED/CP</span>
->
<span style="background-color: black; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">CANCELED/CC</span>

Status can be identified either in their full form or in their short form as shown above (FullForm/ShortForm). Status are all case-insensitive as well.

### Medicine

Medicine are objects that can be added to an order when it is being placed for a person.

A Medicine has the following attribute:
- Full Name of the medication
- An optional short form for the medication

Medicines are uniquely identified by their full and short form names. No two medicine can have the same names.

### Index

Many commands rely on index for execution. Index refers to the numbering in the last shown person/order/medicine list.
All indices have to be positive integers.

As you can refer to the image below index 1 refer to OrderNumber #1 while index 3 refer to OrderNumber #5.

![listp](images/listo.png)

Note: The Index will be based on the command being called and not the displayed list, 
if a command of viewp(view person) is being called, 
the index taken will be based on the person list and not this list being shown currently.

### Fields
* Fields are the different parts of a command.  
e.g. in `editp 1 n/Alex no/penicillin`, there are four fields. Namely, `editp`, `1`, `Alex`, `penicilllin`.    
* Spaces before and after fields will be ignored.
If there are multiple spaces between two words in fields, only one space would be retained.  
As such `Alex Yeoh` will produce the same result as `Alex     Yeoh`  
* To input a `/` character in a field, use another `/` before it.   
If there is an odd  number of consecutive `/`, one of them will be ignored.  
  e.g To input `Roy s/o Balakrishnan`, use `Roy s//o Balakrishnan`

The following fields are used for commands:

| Field         | Prefix | Format                                                                                                        | Example                                    |

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addp n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addp n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PharmHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
